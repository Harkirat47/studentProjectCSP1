From the MiraCosta CS113 course catalog
Students explore the software development process by developing effective solutions using industry-standard tools. Topics include searching, sorting, hashing, algorithm analysis, object-oriented design, collections, lists, stacks, queues, trees, sets, dictionaries, and graphs.

Map the below elements from MiraCosta course description using your CPT project.
This must be unique to your portion of the integrated project.
This is a pre-requisite prior to answering the college board questions that have been posted to AP Classroom.

# SQLite Database Table Creation:
Using VSCode and SQLite3 Editor, create a table in your SQLite database to store your collection data.
Define the columns in your table to represent the attributes of the collection items.
You might create a table named collections with columns like id, name, description, etc.

# Collections

## This is the Database of Images genorated by the model 
<img src="../../../images/IDB.png" alt="image13">

From VSCode model, show your unique code that was created to initialize table and create test data.
See Code Below
Code initializes three users, two default ones as requested by teacher, and an admin account for personal use.


```python
def initEasyImages():
    with app.app_context():
        db.create_all()  # Create all tables if they don't exist
        # Provide paths and metadata for images
        images_data = [
            {"path": "https://t3.ftcdn.net/jpg/03/95/29/32/360_F_395293226_A4boRgABAbfXmAmmynQHcjjIIB3MjDCj.jpg", "_xCoord": 250, "_yCoord": 250, "_difficulty": 0},
            {"path": "https://purepng.com/public/uploads/large/purepng.com-super-mariomariosuper-mariovideo-gamefictional-characternintendoshigeru-miyamotomario-franchise-17015286383789a9am.png", "_xCoord": 250, "_yCoord": 250, "_difficulty": 0}
        ]
        # Create image instances based on the provided data
        images = [Images(**data) for data in images_data]
        # Add images to the database
        for image in images:
            try:
                image.create()
                print("Successfully added entry")
            except:
                db.session.remove()
                print("Error adding image: ", image.imagePath)

```

## This is the code for the model with a function called initEasyImage that adds 2 images as Meta data as seen in the picture above.


```python
# Import necessary modules
from sqlalchemy import Column, Integer, String, Text, LargeBinary
from sqlalchemy.exc import IntegrityError
from pathlib import Path
from __init__ import app, db  # Import Flask app and SQLAlchemy database instance

# Define the Images table in the database
class Images(db.Model):
    __tablename__ = "images"
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    _xCoord = Column(Integer, nullable=False, default=250)  # Default x-coordinate
    _yCoord = Column(Integer, nullable=False, default=250)  # Default y-coordinate
    _difficulty = Column(Integer, nullable=False, default=0)  # Default difficulty level
    imageData = db.Column(db.Text, nullable=True)
    imagePath = db.Column(db.Text, nullable=True)

    # Constructor to initialize an image object
    def __init__(self, imagePath, imageData=None): 
        self.imagePath = imagePath
        self.imageData = imageData

    # Method to represent the image object as a string
    def __repr__(self):
        return f"<image(id='{self.id}', imagePath='{self.imagePath}')>"

    # Method to convert image object to a dictionary
    def to_dict(self):
        return {"id": self.id, "imagePath": self.imagePath}

    # Method to add an image to the database
    def create(self):
        try:
            db.session.add(self)
            db.session.commit()
            return self
        except IntegrityError:
            db.session.remove()
            return None

    # Method to read the details of an image
    def read(self):
        return {
            "path": self.imagePath
        }

    # Method to update the details of an image
    def update(self, path=""):
        if path:
            self.imagePath = path
        db.session.commit()
        return self

    # Method to delete an image from the database
    def delete(self):
        db.session.delete(self)
        db.session.commit()
        return None

# Function to initialize images in the database
def initEasyImages():
    with app.app_context():
        db.create_all()  # Create all tables if they don't exist
        # Provide paths and metadata for images
        images_data = [
            {"path": "https://t3.ftcdn.net/jpg/03/95/29/32/360_F_395293226_A4boRgABAbfXmAmmynQHcjjIIB3MjDCj.jpg", "_xCoord": 250, "_yCoord": 250, "_difficulty": 0},
            {"path": "https://purepng.com/public/uploads/large/purepng.com-super-mariomariosuper-mariovideo-gamefictional-characternintendoshigeru-miyamotomario-franchise-17015286383789a9am.png", "_xCoord": 250, "_yCoord": 250, "_difficulty": 0}
        ]
        # Create image instances based on the provided data
        images = [Images(**data) for data in images_data]
        # Add images to the database
        for image in images:

                print("Successfully added entry")
            except:
                db.session.remove()
                print("Error adding image: ", image.imagePath)

# Call the function to initialize images
initEasyImages()

```

# Lists and Dictionaries
Blog Python API code and use of List and Dictionaries.

In VSCode using Debugger, show a list as extracted from database as Python objects.
GET request is sent to backend to search for all public designs. Backend fetches all public designs into a list in python debugger called design_return (red line). List contains all designs as python objects (red line).



# API + Json

Blog Python API code and use of Postman to request and respond with JSON.

In VSCode, show Python API code definition for request and response using GET, POST, UPDATE methods. Discuss algorithmic condition used to direct request to appropriate Python method based on request method.
Within the code shown above, the API contains several CRUDs, such as a CRUD for modifying users and one for modifying Designs.
A resource is then added to the API under the appropriate link.
When a request is sent to the link, the appropriate function is called according to the type of request send.


```python
# Add resources outside the class definition
images_api.add_resource(ImagesAPI, '/')
images_api.add_resource(PostImagesAPI, '/upload')
```

In VSCode, show algorithmic conditions used to validate data on a POST condition.
Algorithmic conditions ensure that inputted data is valid. The following two conditions are part of the user creation code. They ensure that the password is secure by ensuring that it is longer than a certain length, and ensure that a Name and password exists.


```python
# Validate name
name = body.get('name')
if name is None or len(name) < 2:
    return {'message': 'Name is missing or is less than 2 characters'}, 400

# Validate uid
uid = body.get('uid')
if uid is None or len(uid) < 2:
    return {'message': 'User ID is missing or is less than 2 characters'}, 400
```

In Postman, show URL request and Body requirements for GET, POST, and UPDATE methods.
In Postman, show the JSON response data for 200 success conditions on GET, POST, and UPDATE methods.
