Hello Mr.Mortinson, this is our exit review ticket.

> Weekly finished goals

- For the hacks, I first started with a wireframe similar to the one mr morinson asked for. THere is an added benifit of styling and something that resembles a navbar.

- Then I showed Js output in a console of jupyter notebook

- I made a shuffle button in js to switch links around with math.random function

- I resolved all the errors in the code for last hack and explained what the errors were.
