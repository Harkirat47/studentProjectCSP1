    " This JavaScript function handleFiles is designed to handle files selected by the user, particularly image files. When files are passed to this function, it iterates over each file using a for loop. For each file, it checks if the file type matches that of an image using the file.type.match('image.*') condition. If it's an image file, it proceeds to read the contents of the file using a FileReader. Upon successful reading of the file, it extracts the file name and converts the image data into a base64-encoded string. This base64 string, along with the file name, is then sent to the server via a POST request to the specified endpoint (http://localhost:8086/api/images/upload). The request includes the base64 string and file name in JSON format in the request body. After the upload request is made, it handles the response: if the response is successful, it logs the response data and displays an alert indicating successful upload; if there's an error in the upload process, it logs the error and displays an alert indicating upload failure. This function provides a convenient way to upload images to the server asynchronously."

    "### Key Concepts in Regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Dependent Variable (Outcome)**:\n",
    "   - The dependent variable (often denoted as \\(Y\\)) is the variable we want to predict or explain. It's the outcome of interest in our analysis. For example, in housing prices prediction, the price of the house might be the dependent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Independent Variables (Predictors)**:\n",
    "   - Independent variables (often denoted as \\(X\\)) are the variables that we believe may have an influence on the dependent variable. These are the factors we use to predict or explain variations in the outcome. In the housing prices example, independent variables might include features like square footage, number of bedrooms, location, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Regression Equation**:\n",
    "   - The regression equation represents the relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable. It's expressed mathematically as:\n",
    "     \\[ Y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1X_1 + \\beta_2X_2 + ... + \\beta_nX_n + \\epsilon \\]\n",
    "     - \\(Y\\) is the dependent variable.\n",
    "     - \\(X_1, X_2, ..., X_n\\) are the independent variables.\n",
    "     - \\(\\beta_0, \\beta_1, \\beta_2, ..., \\beta_n\\) are the coefficients (parameters) representing the strength and direction of the relationship between the variables.\n",
    "     - \\(\\epsilon\\) is the error term, representing the difference between the observed and predicted values.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Assumptions**:\n",
    "   - Regression models are based on several assumptions, including linearity, independence of errors, homoscedasticity (constant variance of errors), and normally distributed errors. Violations of these assumptions can affect the validity and reliability of the regression results.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Estimation of Parameters**:\n",
    "   - The goal of regression analysis is to estimate the parameters (\\(\\beta\\) coefficients) of the regression equation that best fit the data. This is typically done using techniques like Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) for linear regression, which minimizes the sum of squared differences between observed and predicted values.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Interpretation of Coefficients**:\n",
    "   - The coefficients (\\(\\beta\\) parameters) in the regression equation represent the change in the dependent variable for a one-unit change in the corresponding independent variable, holding other variables constant. Positive coefficients indicate a positive relationship, while negative coefficients indicate a negative relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Prediction**:\n",
    "   - Once the regression model is fitted, it can be used to make predictions on new or unseen data. By inputting values of the independent variables into the regression equation, we can obtain predicted values for the dependent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Model Evaluation**:\n",
    "   - Regression models need to be evaluated to assess their predictive accuracy and goodness of fit. This involves examining measures such as R-squared (for explaining the proportion of variance in the dependent variable), residual analysis (to check for the randomness of errors), and hypothesis testing on coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, regression analysis provides a framework for quantifying relationships between variables, making predictions, and understanding the underlying patterns in data. It's a versatile tool used in various fields such as economics, finance, social sciences, and more, to analyze and interpret complex relationships in data.\n"

    "### Key Concepts in Decision Trees:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Decision Tree Structure**:\n",
    "   - A decision tree is a hierarchical structure consisting of nodes that represent decision points and branches that represent possible outcomes or paths. At each decision node, a decision is made based on the value of a particular feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Root Node**:\n",
    "   - The top node of the decision tree is called the root node. It represents the entire dataset and is divided into two or more child nodes based on the value of a selected feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Decision Nodes**:\n",
    "   - Decision nodes are internal nodes of the tree where decisions are made based on the values of features. Each decision node represents a specific feature and a corresponding decision rule.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Leaf Nodes**:\n",
    "   - Leaf nodes are terminal nodes of the tree where the final outcome or prediction is made. Each leaf node represents a class label or a numerical value (depending on the type of problem) assigned to the observation that reaches that node.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Splitting Criteria**:\n",
    "   - Splitting criteria determine how the decision tree algorithm chooses the best feature to split the data at each decision node. Common splitting criteria include Gini impurity, entropy, and information gain, which aim to maximize the homogeneity (or purity) of the resulting subsets.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Pruning**:\n",
    "   - Pruning is a technique used to prevent overfitting in decision trees by removing nodes that do not significantly improve the performance of the tree on unseen data. It helps simplify the tree structure and improve its generalization ability.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Tree Depth**:\n",
    "   - The depth of a decision tree refers to the length of the longest path from the root node to a leaf node. Deeper trees may capture more complex patterns in the data but are also more prone to overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Classification vs. Regression Trees**:\n",
    "   - Decision trees can be used for both classification and regression tasks. In classification trees, the leaf nodes represent class labels, while in regression trees, the leaf nodes represent numerical values.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Interpretability**:\n",
    "   - One of the key advantages of decision trees is their interpretability. The decision rules learned by the tree can be easily understood and visualized, making them useful for explaining and communicating insights from the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **Ensemble Methods**:\n",
    "    - Decision trees are often used as building blocks in ensemble learning methods such as Random Forest and Gradient Boosting, where multiple decision trees are combined to improve predictive performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision trees provide a flexible and intuitive approach to predictive modeling, suitable for a wide range of applications in fields such as machine learning, data mining, and pattern recognition.\n"
